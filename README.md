Project Description:   

  

In a coding competition myself and my team wanted to use technology for the social good. In light of what happened in Warsaw 2024, we developed a mobile app dedicated to enhancing public safety for all individuals, regardless of age or gender. This app leverages smart wearable technology to monitor vital signs like heartbeat and blood pressure continuously. In safety mode, it tracks the user's location and biometrics, automatically alerting the police if abnormal readings are detected without user cancellation. Additionally, the app features a community alert system where, in emergencies like a sudden drop in heartbeat, nearby users are notified of the person's location, with the addition of paramedics. Also the location of the closest Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is also provided. An integrated ChatGPT bot provides real-time instructions on how to use the AED, further ensuring immediate assistance is available when needed.
